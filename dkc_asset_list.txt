World 1
  Mechanics
    "spikes" - falling to the bottom of the level is death
    one way platforms
    hooks
    barrels
      static, manaully tiggered
      static, immediate trigger (with arrow showing direction)
      moving, manually triggered
      moving, immediate trigger
    bounce pads - jumping on objects (enemies, barrels, etc) grants extra "jump"
    rope climbing - easy vertical movement, slow/chunky side to side
    swimming
    rhino
    swordfish
    snake
    bees
  
  Enemies
    rats - filler, introduce jumping and cartwheels with minimal failure rate
    basic kremling - larger hitbox requires players to land on platforms with more precision than rats, but otherwise filler
    barrel kremling - runs fast back and forth on a platform, can't be cartwheeled and being hit will push player back (and sometimes off the edge)
    Kaboing v1 - they leap forward in short, predictable hops
    rope sliders - slowly climb up rope and slide down quickly, used to test timing
    basic swimming enemies - just move in simples left/right pattern, teach player underwater precision manuevering
    snappers - more challenging movement patterns than basic swimmers. they are bursty, so if the player gets too close, its really difficult to dodge with the limited manueverability in the water
    starfish - faster, diagonal patters, require player to think farther into the future about where they will need to swim to

World 2
  Mechanics
    lava - basically, "spikes"
    spider
    parrot
    gator heads - basically a bounce pad with a slight, but noticeable delay
    boiling water + seals - a water level with periodic death countdown timer

  Enemies
    barrel dudes - shoot a barrel at the player, that hurts if hit but provides a moving bounce pad
    vultures (swoop in)
    Kaboing v2 - high vertical jump on narrow platform
    boomerang dudes - guy throws an object that comes back to him
    pufferfish

World 3

  Mechanics
    timer barrels - player controls the barrel but has limited time to aim

  Enemies
    phatom guys that throw shit
